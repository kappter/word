## JavaScript Fix Report for Word Creator

**Problem:**

After deploying the rebuilt version, JavaScript errors occurred (`TypeError: Cannot read properties of null`). These errors happened because the JavaScript (`script.js`) was still trying to access and interact with the `themeType` dropdown element, which had been removed from the `index.html` during the rebuild to match the simplified design.

**Analysis:**

The specific errors pointed to lines where the script attempted to:

1.  Read the value of the `themeType` dropdown (`themeType.value`).
2.  Add an event listener to the `themeType` dropdown.

Since the `themeType` element no longer existed in the HTML, these operations resulted in errors because the script was trying to work with a `null` object.

**Solution:**

To resolve these errors while maintaining the simplified design (without the theme dropdown), the following changes were made to `script.js`:

1.  **Removed Element Reference:** The line `const themeType = document.getElementById('themeType');` was commented out, as the element doesn't exist.
2.  **Default Theme:** In the `updateDisplay` function, the line `const theme = themeType.value;` was replaced with `const theme = 'normal';`. This hardcodes the theme to 'normal', allowing the word generation logic to proceed without needing the dropdown. If theme selection is desired later, the HTML and JS would need further modification.
3.  **Removed Event Listener:** The line `themeType.addEventListener('change', updateDisplay);` was commented out, as there is no `themeType` element to attach a listener to.

**Result:**

With these modifications, the JavaScript no longer attempts to access the non-existent `themeType` element. Local testing confirmed that the JavaScript errors are resolved, and the word generation functionality works correctly using the default 'normal' theme.

**Attached Files:**

*   The updated `script.js` file containing these fixes.
*   The `index.html` file (unchanged from the last version provided).
