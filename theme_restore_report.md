## Theme Selector Restoration Report

**Goal:**

Restore the theme selector functionality to the Word Creator project, as requested by the user, after it was previously removed to match a reference image.

**Changes Implemented:**

1.  **HTML (`index.html`):**
    *   The theme selector dropdown (`<select id="themeType">...`) was added back into the `.controls` div, alongside the existing word type dropdown.
    *   Appropriate labels were ensured for both dropdowns.
    *   The structure within `.controls` was adjusted slightly to accommodate both dropdowns side-by-side (using nested divs).

2.  **JavaScript (`script.js`):**
    *   The line `const themeType = document.getElementById("themeType");` was uncommented to re-establish the reference to the theme dropdown element.
    *   In the `updateDisplay` function, the line `const theme = themeType.value;` was restored, replacing the hardcoded `const theme = 'normal';`. This ensures the selected theme from the dropdown is used.
    *   The line `themeType.addEventListener("change", updateDisplay);` was uncommented to re-attach the event listener, ensuring that changing the theme dropdown triggers a word regeneration.

**Result:**

With these modifications, the theme selector dropdown is now present in the UI, and the JavaScript correctly uses the selected theme value for word generation. Local testing confirmed that both dropdowns function as expected, and changing the theme updates the generated words accordingly.

**Attached Files:**

*   The updated `index.html` file with the theme dropdown restored.
*   The updated `script.js` file with theme functionality restored.
*   The `style.css` file (unchanged from the last version).
