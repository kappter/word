## Word Creator Rebuild Report

**Goal:**

Rebuild the front-end of the Word Creator project to resolve persistent CSS loading issues and match the user-provided reference image, addressing user frustration with previous troubleshooting attempts.

**Approach:**

Instead of further patching the existing files, a clean rebuild was performed:

1.  **New HTML (`index.html`):** A new HTML file was created with a clean structure, referencing only the necessary CSS (`style.css`) and JavaScript (`script.js`). It implements the layout seen in the reference image (title, single dropdown, word display area, buttons).
2.  **New CSS (`style.css`):** A dedicated CSS file was created containing all the styles required to match the reference image (fonts, colors, layout, button styles, responsiveness). This consolidates styling and avoids reliance on potentially conflicting external or inline styles from the previous versions.
3.  **Existing JavaScript (`script.js`):** The original `script.js` file, responsible for the word generation logic, was retained and linked correctly in the new HTML.
4.  **Data (`data/word_parts.csv`):** The original data file was kept in its `data` subdirectory.
5.  **README:** The original README was included.

**Result:**

Local testing confirmed that this rebuilt version loads correctly without the previous 404 errors for CSS files. The appearance matches the reference image, and the word generation functionality provided by `script.js` is integrated.

**Deliverables:**

The final set of files required for the project are:

*   `index.html`
*   `style.css`
*   `script.js`
*   `data/word_parts.csv`
*   `README.markdown`

These files have been organized in a clean structure and are ready for deployment. They are provided in the attached zip archive.

**Next Steps (User):**

1.  Download the attached `word_creator_final.zip` file.
2.  Extract the contents.
3.  Upload these files (including the `data` directory) to your empty GitHub repository (`https://github.com/kappter/word`).
4.  Enable GitHub Pages for the repository (usually on the `main` branch, root directory) to make the project live.
